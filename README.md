# Brewmaster-Kit


## Purpose
As a Mac Systems Admin, I've frequently found myself in the field with only access to a new/naked machine. In the heat of the moment, this is often a challenge as the machine doesn't have all the tools I'm used to operating with. The goal of this project is to create a streamline re-deployment process for all of these tools. In the future this will be built out with automation flows, but for now it will just a be a list of the tools I actively am using at the time. 

This list is not intended to be fully comprehnsive of every tool available out there. That is better suited for projects like https://github.com/jaywcjlove/awesome-mac or https://github.com/serhii-londar/open-source-mac-os-apps (of which this list was largely built from, including emojis). Instead this will only be tools that are used on a regular basis and thus will be updated regulalry with some tools dropping off over time.
